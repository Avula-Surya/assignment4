      On the Insert tab, the galleries include items that are designed to
      coordinate with the overall look of your document. You can use these
      galleries to insert tables, headers, footers, lists, cover pages, and
      other document building blocks. When you create pictures, charts, or
      diagrams, they also coordinate with your current document look. You can
      easily change the formatting of selected text in the document text by
      using a look for the selected text from the Quick Style gallery on the
      Home tab. Most controls offer a choice of using the look from the current
      theme or using a format that you specify directly. To change the overall
      look of your document, choose new Theme elements on the Page Layout tab.
      To change the looks available in the Quick Style gallery, use the Change
      Current Quick Style Set command. Both the Themes gallery and the Quick
      Styles gallery provide reset commands so that you can always restore the
      look of your document to the original contained in your current template.
